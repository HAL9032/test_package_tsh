## Overview

**Test Package TSH** is a minimalistic Python project example. It is meant to be used **for educational purposes only**. I am just writing because I want some more sample text. I really don't know what else to say. Except maybe that it is way too warm at the moment. Hopefully winter is coming soon...

## Basic Usage

How you can use **Test Package TSH** to do absolutely useless things:

1. **Import:** Import the library.
    ```python
    import test_package_tsh as tp
    ```

2. **Run Functions:** Run some functions.
    ```python
    tp.sp1.m1_fn1()
    ```

3. **Realize it can't do anything:** You've come a long way but start to realize it really is just a 'package' for learning purposes.

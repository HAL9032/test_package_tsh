## Overview

**Test Package** is a minimalistic Python project example. It is meant to be used **for educational purposes only**. I am just writing because I want some more sample text. I really don't know what else to say. Except maybe that it is way too warm at the moment. Hopefully winter is coming soon...

## Installation

Simply install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install test_package
```

## Usage

Here's how you can use **Test Package** to do absolutely useless things:

1. **Import:** Import the library.
    ```python
    import test_package as tp
    ```

2. **Run Functions:** Run some functions.
    ```python
    tp.sp1.m1_fn1()
    ```

3. **Realize it can't do anything:** You've come a long way but start to realize it really is just a \`package\` for learning purposes.

## Features

- **Easy Setup:** Simple installation and configuration process.
- **Useless Functions:** Offers absolutely useless functions, and nothing more.
- **Literally Nothing:** Really... there is nothing more to it...
